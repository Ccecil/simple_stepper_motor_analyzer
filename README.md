# Simple Stepper Motor Analyzer

Modifications made in this branch are largely due to parts shortages.  This allows the use of the TMCS1100A4-Q1 current sensor as an option.
Changes made:
-Current sensor layout and traces
-Added jumpers for switching 3.3/5v to the current sensors
-Added voltage dividers to setup vref for the TMCS1100A4-Q1 (DNP if using default sensor)
-Holes placed to orient the Stencil8 jig for ease of paste stenciling.

## Overview
Diagnosing the operation of stepper motor in 3D printers and CNC machines used to require stepper motor analyzers that costs thousands of dollar. Not anymore! The Simple Stepper Analyzer ('Analyzer' in short) brings these capabilities to every maker for a tiny fraction of the price and with a minimalist DIY electronic design that leaves the heavy lifting to the firmware.

The Analyzer is self contained, has two 4-wires pass-through connectors connecting the stepper motor, is powered from a common 5V charger with a micro USB cable, provides a simple to use graphical user interface with a 3.5" color touch screen, and provides a plethora of stepper motor measurements.

The Analyzer is provided to the community as a public domain reference design that can be built and used as is, or be customized with additional features or for a lower cost as desired. The hardware and firmware come with a liberal open source license (CC0) that allows commercial usages and doesn't require code source code sharing.

## How does it work?
The principle of operation is very simple, and so is the hardware design. The stepper motor is connected via 4 wire pass-though connectors that allow the Analyzer to monitor the current through the stepper's coils. The Analyzer's user low impedance current sensors that are galvanically isolated such does not interfere with the operation of the 3D printer or other equipment it monitors. The Analyzer measures the coils currents 100k times a second and uses firmware that analyzes the data, extracts the desired measurements, and present them on the screen. For example, this is how an analysis of the distribution of distance by speed distribution looks like:


![](./www/distance_by_speed_screen.png)

---
## Operation is simple and intuitive

1. Turn off power to the equipment (e.g. 3D printer).
2. Disconnect the 4 wires of the stepper motor and connect them through the Analyzer two pass through connectors.
3. Power the analyzer using a 5V charger and a micro USB cable.
4. Turn on the equipment and get the stepper going.
5. Use the Analyzer's screen to view the measurements you want.

**NOTE:** The two pass-through connectors of the Analyzer are symmetric and  each can act as an input or output. 

**CAUTION:** Always connect and disconnect stepper motors when their controller is not energized, to reduce the risk of damage to the controller due to high voltage spikes. The analyser itself is not subject to that risk since its uses galvanically isolated current sensors.

![](./www/wiring_diagram.png)

**NOTE:** The only requirement for proper wiring is that the two wires of one coil should go through pins pair 1,2 and the two wires of the other coil should go through pin pair 3,4. The Analyzer doesn't care about the +/- polarity of the wires in each pair, nor does it care which of the two pass-through connectors is on the controller side and which one is on the stepper side.

**TRIVIA:**: The pin-out and the connector type of the Analyzer follows the Duet3D conventions, except that is uses right angle connector to save space.

## The Home Page
The Home page is first page shown when the Analyzer is powered on. It provides summary information as well as access to the Settings page.

#### Page Data

Field | Description
:------------ | :-------------
 COIL&nbsp;1 | Momentary coil 1 current in Amps.
 COIL&nbsp;2 | Momentary coil 2 current in Amps.
 ERRORS | The number of phase errors detected so far. Phase errors happens when the current patterns are so distorted that a forward/backward movement cannot be determined.
 POWER | Indicates if the stepper motor is currently energized. This is determined by the sum of currents in they two coils.
 IDLES | The number of times that stepper motor change status from energized to non energized.
 STEPS | The distance the stepper moved so far. Each full step forward increments this value by one and each full step backward decrements it by one. When the stepper motor is energized, the display also shows fractional steps in resolution of 1/100th of a full step.


HINT: The fractional step value cannot be reset because it is derived from the momentary currents in the two coils. Only the stepper motor driver can reset the fraction by positioning the stepper motor on an exact full step.

HINT: To swap forward/backward directions of the Analyzer use the Settings page. This does not affect the stepper motor itself.

## Coil Current Patterns Page

This page shows the current patterns in the two stepper coils.

The screenshot below shows a healthy system where the signals are nice and clean and reaches the target peak current.

![](./www/signal_graph_screen.png)

&nbsp;

The screenshot below is from a poor system where high speed results in distorted and insufficient current, resulting in loss of torque and a potential for skipped steps.

![](./www/signal_graph2_screen.png)

&nbsp;

**GENERAL INFORMATION:** Each cycle of the stepper current pattern represent 4 full steps. The centers of those steps are at on the four vertical dotted lines where the currents of the two coils are identical, in the same or in  opposite polarities. The transitions between the steps are on the 4 vertical solid lines where one of the coils is at zero current. This cycle of 4 full steps is sometimes referred to as a single 'electric rotation'. The analyzer computes the exact phase on this cycle using the standard trigonometric function atan2(current1, current2) which can also be calculated manually from the current readings in the Home page.

## Coil Current Phase Page

This page draws the current patterns of the two coils as a [Lissajous curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) which allows to examine visually distortions such as non sinusoidal current, phase distortion, and reduced amplitude.

In an ideal system, the graph is a perfect smooth circle, that doesn't change its size when the stepper's speed changes. Patterns that significantly diverge from that indicates a sub optimal configuration and operation.

Following picture shows a pattern from a well functioning system. The graph is round, reasonable smooth, and has sufficient size which indicates good current drive. 

The horizontal axis indicates the coil 1 current and the vertical axis indicates coil 2 current. In this example, both span nicely between -2A to +2A.

![](./www/phase_screen_good.png)

&nbsp;

The screenshot below is from a poor system where high speed results in distorted and insufficient current, resulting in loss of torque and a potential for skipped steps. The pattern is far from a clean circle and the shape has reduced size.

![](./www/phase_screen_starved.png)

&nbsp;

The screenshot below shows a sub optimal operation where a a speed increase of the stepper results in small (less current and torque) and even more distorted curve.

![](./www/phase_screen_accelerating.png)


&nbsp;

The screenshot below shows a well functioning system. The smaller size of the circle compare to the example above indicates that it operates on lower current.

![](./www/phase_screen_good_small.png)


&nbsp;

The screenshot below show an operation of a stepper in full steps mode. The dimension of the pattern indicate good current feed, and the square  shape is the best a full step driver can deliver.

![](./www/phase_screen_full_steps.png)


&nbsp;

The screenshot below show an operation of a stepper in half steps mode. The dimension of the pattern indicate good current feed, and the shape is somewhere between the square shape of full step mode and the round shape of micro stepping interpolation mode.

## I want to build me one

The electronic schematic, PCB layout, gerber files, and the firmware source files and released binary are all available on this github repository.

[Schematic](./kicad/stepper_analyzer.pdf)

[Production files](./kicad/JLCPCB)

[BOM](./kicad/BOM.xlsx)

&nbsp;

**Instructions:** Order the PCB with JLCPB with SMD service (see JLCPCB directory with gerbers and bom and pos files). Attach the Pico with XFasten tape and solder. Cut the bottom pins of the KF2510 connectors to 1mm length and solder from the top of the PCB only. Solder the current sensors, attach the TFT to the back of the PCB with XFasten tape and carefully connect the two FPC cables. Program the Pico by connecting it to a computer while it's bootsel button is pressed and drag he uf2 release file to the virtual disk you will see on your computer.

Note: The two servo connectors may be hard to insert and remove due to a small bump on the male side that is intended to lock in place the female connector. If you are handy with X-Acto knife, you can try carefully scraping that bump for easier insertion as I did (knives are sharp and may be dangarous, use proper precautions).

## Mechanical
3D print the two part of the enclosure (STL files in this github repository), insert the four M2.5x3.5x3 heated inserts with a solder iron, drill the four  2.5 holes in the cover, insert the PCB to the front part, make sure the TFT seats flush with front and secure the back with four M2.5x10 hex cup screws.


## Ideas for improvements
The Analyzer is provided as a fully functional reference design and changes and the developers encourage improvement/modifications of the hardware and/or firmware are encouraged. This can include new features, new measurements and pages, extending the design to support 2 or 3 steppers at once to track the x/y/z of a 3D printer, reducing the hardware cost using less expensive screen TFT, or even eliminating the screen altogether and using the Analyzer as a dongle tethered to a computer via the existing USB/Serial link.

## FAQ

#### Q: Can I buy from you a few units?

A: We cannot provide assembled units for the general public. For that reason, we released the design with CC Zero license with the hope that other entrepreneurs will do so.

#### Q: Where do you source the TFT panels?

A: We buy the '3.5 LCD CTP' variant here https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32862869103.html. The choice of TFT panel and the mechanical design of the PCB follows Dustin Watts' ESP32 Touchdown project https://www.tindie.com/products/dustinwattsnl/esp32-touchdown/ (with extra 2mm to the PCB's length for extra clearance for the threaded heat inserts).

#### Q: Can the firmware of the analyzer be updated?

A: Yes. New firmware is released as .uf2 files. To flash the analyzer with a compatible .uf2 follow the standard procedure of the Raspberry Pi Pico. Access to the BOTSEL button is provided by a hole at the back of the 3D printed enclosure.

#### Q: Why some footprints on the PCB are not populated?

A: The PCB design includes circuitry that helps developing firmware for the analyzer that is not necessary or helpful for normal opeation of the analyzer.

#### Q: Can the current scale of the two channels increased from +/-2.5A?

A: The PCB was designed to accept also +/-5A variants of the current sensors and the optionals resistors R8 R9 were added to allow configuring the firmware to know about the larger current scale. This however was not tried yet since most 3D printer steppers do not exceed currents of 2.5A.

#### Q: Why not a SPI based TFT?

A: We could not achieve fast enough display refresh rate with SPI so switched to 16 bit parallel data transfers. With the optimized firmware we can update rate equivalent to 200Mhz SPI. 

#### Q: Can a cheaper TFT/touch be used?
A: Yes, but it will require design changes.

#### Q: Can the TFT screen be eliminated?
A: Yes. The Analyzer has a USB/Serial output can a small Analyzer dongle can communicate with a computer program. This will require firmware changes.
  

#### Q: Can you add feature X or customization Y?

A: Most likely not. The reference design is provided for the community to change and mix.

#### Q: I want to commercialize or crowd source it, can you help me?

A: Not really. The reference design is open source and you will need to find others to help you. We don't mind though to answer questions.

#### Q: Where do I file a bug?

A: Use the github repository.

#### Q: Is it ok to connect/disconnect power to the Analyzer while my 3D printer prints?

A: Of course. The Analyzer is isolated from the stepper wires and should not interfere with the operation of the printer.

#### Q: The Analyzer uses LVGL lib, what is the license of that library?

A: At the time of writing this, the LVGL license is available here https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/master/LICENCE.txt.  The Analyzer's developers are not affiliated with LVGL.

#### Q: Is the LVGL library included in the Analyzer's repository?

A: It's not needed. LVGL is supported by platform.io so the Analyzer's project is set for platform.io to fetch LVGL automatically.

#### Q: Can the firmware be built with the standard Raspberry Pi Pico C++ SDK?

A: It should be but we didn't try it. Installing the SDK, libraries and tools using platformio and the WizIO Pico 'baremetal' distribution is easier.
